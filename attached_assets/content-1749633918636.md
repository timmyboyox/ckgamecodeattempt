# Crusader Knights - text based browser game, HELP

I used to play this when I was like 10, was an awesome game. Text based, black background - option to buy your own empire and put them onto the graphical map (armies would be represented with a small cost of arms in the box (small area on large map).


You could gather resources by putting armies on it, you could send knights on crusades and whatnot.


Was an awesome game but the bloke running it (in-game called pope) took it down due to lack of funding or whatnot - being the only developer and server runner.


I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE GUY SO I CAN PURCHASE THE CODE FOR THIS GAME!!!! Its such a log shot but if you remember this game please leave a comment even if you don't know 'pope'! Hopefully you've found something similar that I haven't :0


My browser based thirst hasn't been quenched in like 10 years since I last played that!

QUICK UPDATE:


I checked my old mail, found 'pope's' email address but unfortunately emails are undelivered when sent. As expected. [Pope@crusaderknights.net](mailto:Pope@crusaderknights.net)

You may want to ask around [r/StrategyRPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrategyRPG/), [r/tipofmytongue](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/) and [r/tipofmyjoystick](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/)! Good luck!


How much money were you planning on spending for the whole codebase, if you don't mind me asking?

Thank you, when I'm at home I'll put this on to those subs as well!


Honestly? I was hoping the guy would be happy to sell it for a low price as he took it down due to lack of funding and I know he would sell because I asked (silly ten year old) if he'd sell me it when he announced the closure! But realistically I'm willing to pay for it, nothing ridiculous but I enjoyed it enough to run into 000's.

Do you remember the URL? Running a [WHOIS](https://whois.icann.org/en) search on it might turn something up.

Could you give more info? The link to it if you still remember, or a round idea what it was.

UPDATE:


I done some searching, it was a variant of the legend of the green dragon game!


Now I know how to reproduce it (or... I mean I have the code that can be altered)!


Thank you everyone for your help and input! If you're interested in helping out or even playing check my latest post, I run through some ideas on that!

UPDATE:


Found the owner “pope”


He won’t share the code or images to allow the game to be brought back to life


He may release the game again within the next decade or so once he retires


Sad result given the years of searching…

That's the problem I've had for years, frankly it's as though the game didn't exist. I remember seeing it on a ranking forum (you know, they link you to a forum and when you up vote they reward with in game resources) years and years ago but other than that it's gone dark!
