1. Project Overview

Crusader Knights Revival is a medieval‚Äêthemed, browser‚Äêbased strategy/RPG hybrid.

Let‚Äôs Discuss Next Steps

    Prioritize which systems (combat, economy, diplomacy) to build first.

    Define detailed specs for quests, companion progression, and map size.

    Storyboard user flows for key interactions (e.g., hiring, questing, battling).

    Set up server persistence and asset pipelines (images, audio).

I‚Äôm ready to start implementing whichever module you‚Äôd like to tackle next‚Äîjust point me at the top priorities!
