# \[TOMT\] Crusader Knights - text based browser game, HELP

I used to play this when I was like 10, was an awesome game. Text based, black background - option to buy your own empire and put them onto the graphical map (armies would be represented with a small cost of arms in the box (small area on large map).


You could gather resources by putting armies on it, you could send knights on crusades and whatnot.


Was an awesome game but the bloke running it (in-game called pope) took it down due to lack of funding or whatnot - being the only developer and server runner.


I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE GUY SO I CAN PURCHASE THE CODE FOR THIS GAME!!!! Its such a log shot but if you remember this game please leave a comment even if you don't know 'pope'! Hopefully you've found something similar that I haven't :0


My browser based thirst hasn't been quenched in like 10 years since I last played that!
